In case anyone got lost here, hi! I'm Muhammad Kemal Abizar, and this is my GitHub page.

It's mostly filled with random shenanigans that I impulsively wanna built, and also unfinished projects that age like wine. If you find my repositories being useful, do consider following me and star the repos you like; if you wanna use my repos for your purposes, please include the copyrights included inside README files. And I'd really appreciate any advice/critique/questions about my projects, where you can contact me through the links below.
